Either type the switch number (1 to 5) to change its setting,
Set any switch explicitly (e.g. type 'madspin=ON' at the prompt)
Type 'help' for the list of all valid option
Type '0', 'auto', 'done' or just press enter when you are done.[60s to answer]

 you can also
   - enter the path to a valid card or banner.
   - use the 'set' command to modify a parameter directly.
     The set option works only for param_card and run_card.
     Type 'help set' for more information on this command.
   - call an external program (ASperGE/MadWidth/...).
     Type 'help' for the list of available command
