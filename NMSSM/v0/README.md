Numerical table directly extracted from [1]. In this reference the H BR's vary point by point.
- To normalized to the HY(bb) results we used the H(bb)Y(bb) and normalized the H(bb) using the values that were used to compute the cross -section, as this information is also provided by the authors (Hbb BR can vary up to 20% depending on the point)
